## Crypto Automation Platforms

### Gelato Network:
 Gelato is a leading decentralized automation protocol for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It offers several key services:

- Automate: This service enables developers to create automated workflows for smart contracts, similar to how Zapier works for web2 applications. It allows for the configuration of smart contract automation through a user interface, SDK, or smart contract itself.
- Relay: This feature enables gasless transactions, allowing users to execute transactions without directly paying gas fees. This can significantly improve user experience by removing the friction of gas payments.
- Web3 Functions: This service allows developers to connect smart contracts to any HTTP APIs, including price feeds and databases, without running their own backend infrastructure

### Additional Automation Tools:
- Chainlink Automation (formerly Keeper Network): This tool provides smart contract automation services, allowing developers to automate contract functions based on predefined conditions.
- OpenZeppelin Defender: A security-focused automation platform that offers features like automated contract management and secure transaction relaying.
